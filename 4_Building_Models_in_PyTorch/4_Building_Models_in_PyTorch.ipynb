    "In this video, we'll be discussing some of the tools PyTorch makes available for building deep learning networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except for `Parameter`, the classes we discuss in this video are all subclasses of `torch.nn.Module`. This is the PyTorch base class meant to encapsulate behaviors specific to PyTorch Models and their components.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important behavior of `torch.nn.Module` is registering parameters. If a particular `Module` subclass has learning weights, these weights are expressed as instances of `torch.nn.Parameter`. The `Parameter` class is a subclass of `torch.Tensor`, with the special behavior that when they are assigned as attributes of a `Module`, they are added to the list of that modules parameters. These parameters may be accessed through the `parameters()` method on the `Module` class.\n",

    "As a simple example, here's a very simple model with two linear layers and an activation function. We'll create an instance of it and ask it to report on its parameters:"

    "* LeNet5 is meant to take in a 1x32x32 black & white image. **The first argument to a convolutional layer's constructor is the number of input channels.** Here, it is 1. If we were building this model to look at 3-color channels, it would be 3.\n",
    "* A convolutional layer is like a window that scans over the image, looking for a pattern it recognizes. These patterns are called *features,* and one of the parameters of a convolutional layer is the number of features we would like it to learn. **This is the second argument to the constructor is the number of output features.** Here, we're asking our layer to learn 6 features.\n",
    "* Just above, I likened the convolutional layer to a window - but how big is the window? **The third argument is the window or *kernel* size.** Here, the \"5\" means we've chosen a 5x5 kernel. (If you want a kernel with height different from width, you can specify a tuple for this argument - e.g., `(3, 5)` to get a 3x5 convolution kernel.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a convolutional layer is an *activation map* - a spatial representation of the presence of features in the input tensor. `conv1` will give us an output tensor of 6x28x28; 6 is the number of features, and 28 is the height and width of our map. (The 28 comes from the fact that when scanning a 5-pixel window over a 32-pixel row, there are only 28 valid positions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We then pass the output of the convolution through a ReLU activation function (more on activation functions later), then through a max pooling layer. The max pooling layer takes features near each other in the activation map and groups them together. It does this by reducing the tensor, merging every 2x2 group of cells in the output into a single cell, and assigning that cell the maximum value of the 4 cells that went into it. This gives us a lower-resolution version of the activation map, with dimensions 6x14x14.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next convolutional layer, `conv2`, expects 6 input channels (corresponding to the 6 features sought by the first layer), has 16 output channels, and a 3x3 kernel. It puts out a 16x12x12 activation map, which is again reduced by a max pooling layer to 16x6x6. Prior to passing this output to the linear layers, it is reshaped to a 16 * 6 * 6 = 576-element vector for consumption by the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are convolutional layers for addressing 1D, 2D, and 3D tensors. There are also many more optional arguments for a conv layer constructor, including stride length(e.g., only scanning every second or every third position) in the input, padding (so you can scan out to the edges of the input), and more.

The `torch.nn.Transformer` class also has classes to encapsulate the individual components (`TransformerEncoder`, `TransformerDecoder`) and subcomponents (`TransformerEncoderLayer`, `TransformerDecoderLayer`).
